# Analysis-of-Valorant-Agent-Performance-
Valorant agents’ analyasis using performance metrics to identify correlations, outliers, and role balance using Python and Tableau.

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Valorant agents’ performance using key metrics such as :
* Kill-Death ratio (K/D Ratio)
*  Average Combat Score (ACS)
*  pick rate And win rate.

 By scraping up-to-date data and employing statistical methods and visualizations in Python and Tableau, the study identifies correlations, outliers, and role balance within the Iron rank. 
 
 The analysis highlights standout agents, uncovers potential imbalances, and offers insights into agent usage and effectiveness, supporting better game balance and design decisions.

* Results : 
 The top-performing agents identified were Reyna and KillJoy, both showing high win rates around 49.6%.

Reyna also led in Kill-Death ratio (KD) and Average Combat Score (ACS), making her a strong combat agent. 

Sage had the highest pick rate but lower KD and ACS, reflecting a supportive role rather than combat dominance.
